            <ol>
              <li><strong>Introduction (2 lines):</strong> Define the core term. (e.g., <em>"MANET is a decentralized network..."</em>)</li>
              <li><strong>The Diagram (Crucial):</strong> Draw a block diagram. Even a simple box-and-arrow diagram is better than nothing. Label it clearly.</li>
              <li><strong>Core Concept (Bullet Points):</strong> Explain the "How" and "Why". Use subheadings.</li>
              <li><strong>Advantages & Disadvantages:</strong> Always list 3 Pros and 2 Cons.</li>
              <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Give one example (e.g., <em>"Used in Military/Disaster Relief"</em>).</li>

          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>User/Device</strong> (Left side)</li>
            <li>A <strong>Network/Medium</strong> (Middle cloud)</li>
            <li>A <strong>Server/Database</strong> (Right side)</li>
