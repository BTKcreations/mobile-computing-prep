    { unit: "I", id: 1, question: "Differentiate between User Mobility and Device Portability.", answer: "<strong>User Mobility:</strong> The user can move between different physical locations and use different devices (e.g., logging into Gmail from any PC).<br/><strong>Device Portability:</strong> The device itself can be moved to different locations while maintaining connectivity (e.g., a smartphone)." },
    { unit: "I", id: 2, question: "What is Spread Spectrum?", answer: "<strong>Spread Spectrum:</strong> A technique where a signal is transmitted on a bandwidth much larger than the frequency content of the original information. This minimizes interference, prevents jamming, and improves security (e.g., CDMA)." },
    { unit: "II", id: 3, question: "What is Frequency Reuse?", answer: "<strong>Frequency Reuse:</strong> The practice of using the same radio frequencies in different geographic areas (cells) that are separated by sufficient distance to avoid interference. This increases the total capacity of the network." },
    { unit: "II", id: 4, question: "Define Agent Advertisement.", answer: "<strong>Agent Advertisement:</strong> A method in Mobile IP where Home Agents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA) periodically broadcast their presence (using ICMP Router Discovery) to let Mobile Nodes know which network they are currently in." },
    { unit: "III", id: 5, question: "What is Fast Retransmit?", answer: "<strong>Fast Retransmit:</strong> A TCP enhancement where the sender retransmits a packet immediately after receiving 3 duplicate ACKs, without waiting for the timeout timer to expire. It assumes the packet was lost, not delayed." },
    { unit: "III", id: 6, question: "Define Transaction Oriented TCP.", answer: "<strong>T-TCP:</strong> A TCP extension designed to make TCP more efficient for short transactions (request-response). It combines the connection setup (SYN), data transfer, and connection teardown (FIN) into fewer packets." },
    { unit: "IV", id: 7, question: "What is Indexing in data dissemination?", answer: "<strong>Indexing:</strong> A power-saving technique where a directory (index) of data locations is broadcasted before the actual data. Clients read the index, sleep, and wake up only when their desired data arrives." },
    { unit: "IV", id: 8, question: "What is Cache Invalidation?", answer: "<strong>Cache Invalidation:</strong> The process of ensuring data consistency. When data on the server changes, the server must notify clients to remove or mark as invalid their local cached copies." },
    { unit: "V", id: 9, question: "What is a Wormhole Attack?", answer: "<strong>Wormhole Attack:</strong> A severe attack in MANETs where two attackers connected by a high-speed link record packets at one location and replay them at another, creating a false shortcut that disrupts routing." },
    { unit: "V", id: 10, question: "Define J2ME.", answer: "<strong>Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME):</strong> A Java platform designed for embedded systems and mobile devices (like old Nokias).

            <div class="model-answer-pro">
              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p>Switching is the method used to route data/voice from source to destination. The two fundamental types are <strong>Circuit Switching</strong> (Traditional Telecom) and <strong>Packet Switching</strong> (Internet).</p>

              <h4>2. Circuit Switching (The "Reserved Lane")</h4>
              <p>Before communication starts, a dedicated physical path (circuit) is established.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Connection-Oriented:</strong> Setup -> Transfer -> Teardown.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Reservation:</strong> Bandwidth is reserved for the entire duration. If you stop talking, the line sits idle (Wasted).</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Constant delay, no jitter. Good for real-time voice.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> PSTN (Landline), GSM Voice.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3. Packet Switching (The "Postal Service")</h4>
              <p>Data is broken into small chunks called <strong>Packets</strong>. Each packet travels independently.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Connectionless:</strong> No dedicated path. Packets may take different routes.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Bandwidth is shared. If you are silent, others use the line.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> High utilization of the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Variable delay (Jitter). Packets may arrive out of order.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Internet (IP), GPRS, LTE.</li>

              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p><strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</strong> is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other parameters (Subnet Mask, Gateway) to devices connecting to a network.</p>

              <h4>2. The DORA Process</h4>
              <p>DHCP works in 4 steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Discover (Broadcast):</strong> The client shouts "Is there a DHCP server here?" (IP: 0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255).</li>
                <li><strong>Offer (Unicast/Broadcast):</strong> The server replies "Yes, I have IP 192.168.1.5 available."</li>
                <li><strong>Request (Broadcast):</strong> The client says "Great, I'll take 192.168.1.5."</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge (Unicast):</strong> The server confirms "Okay, it's yours for 24 hours."</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Assigning CoA:</strong> When a Mobile Node (MN) enters a foreign network, it needs a Care-of Address (CoA). It can use DHCP to obtain this address from the foreign network's server. This is called a <strong>Co-located CoA</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobility Support:</strong> DHCP allows a device to plug into any network and get a valid configuration instantly without manual setup, enabling basic portability.</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> DHCP automates the complex task of network configuration, making it a cornerstone of plug-and-play connectivity and a key enabler for mobile roaming.

            <div class="model-answer-pro">
              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p><strong>Mobile IP (RFC 3344)</strong> is an extension of the Internet Protocol (IP) that allows a user to move from one network to another while maintaining the same permanent IP address. This transparency is achieved through specific entities.</p>

              <h4>2. Key Entities</h4>

              <h5>A. Mobile Node (MN)</h5>
              <p>The device (laptop, phone) that changes its point of attachment.
                <br><em>Role:</em> It wants to keep its connection alive while moving.</p>

              <h5>B. Home Agent (HA)</h5>
              <p>A router on the MN's <strong>Home Network</strong>.
                <br><em>Role:</em> It acts as the anchor. It intercepts packets destined for the MN and tunnels them to the MN's current location.</p>

              <h5>C. Foreign Agent (FA)</h5>
              <p>A router on the <strong>Visited (Foreign) Network</strong>.
                <br><em>Role:</em> It acts as the endpoint of the tunnel. It receives packets from the HA, decapsulates them, and delivers them to the MN.</p>

              <h5>D. Correspondent Node (CN)</h5>
              <p>The peer device communicating with the MN (e.g., a Web Server).
                <br><em>Role:</em> It is unaware of the MN's mobility. It sends packets to the MN's Home IP.</p>

              <h4>3. Key Addresses</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Home Address:</strong> The permanent IP address assigned to the MN. It never changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Care-of Address (CoA):</strong> A temporary IP address that identifies the MN's current location in the foreign network.
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Foreign Agent CoA:</em> The IP address of the FA.</li>
                    <li><em>Co-located CoA:</em> A temporary IP assigned directly to the MN (via DHCP).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p><strong>WAP</strong> was the first global standard to bring internet content to mobile phones (before modern smartphones). It was designed to handle the limitations of early mobile networks (low bandwidth, high latency) and devices (small screens, low CPU).</p>

              <h4>2. The WAP Model (Gateway Approach)</h4>
              <p>Unlike the standard web where a browser talks directly to a server, WAP uses a <strong>WAP Gateway</strong> in the middle.</p>

                <br>- <strong>Content Encoding:</strong> Compresses text (WML) into binary to save bandwidth.</p>

              <h4>3. WAP Protocol Stack (The "WAP Gap")</h4>

                <li><strong>WTLS:</strong> Provided end-to-end security, but had a vulnerability at the Gateway where data had to be decrypted and re-encrypted (The "WAP Gap").</li>
                <li><strong>WTP:</strong> Provided reliable request/response without the overhead of TCP.</li>

          question: "Discuss the issues in Client-Server computing in mobile environments.",
          answer: `
            <div class="model-answer-pro">
              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p>The traditional Client-Server model assumes a fast, reliable, and permanent connection (like Ethernet). Mobile environments violate these assumptions, introducing significant challenges.</p>

              <h4>2. Key Issues</h4>

              <h5>A. Bandwidth & Latency</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Bandwidth:</strong> Wireless is slower than wired. Sending large data takes time.</li>
                <li><strong>High Latency:</strong> Round-trip time (RTT) is high. "Chatty" protocols (many small requests) perform poorly.</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> Downlink (Server to Phone) is fast. Uplink (Phone to Server) is slow.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>B. Reliability & Disconnection</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequent Disconnections:</strong> Users enter tunnels or dead zones. Active transactions may fail or hang.</li>
                <li><strong>Packet Loss:</strong> High error rates due to interference.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>C. Device Constraints</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Continuous network usage drains battery. The client cannot stay "Always On".</li>
                <li><strong>Storage/CPU:</strong> Mobile clients cannot process or store huge datasets like a desktop.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3. Adaptation Strategies (Solutions)</h4>
              
              <h5>A. Caching</h5>
              <p>Store data locally.
                <br><em>Benefit:</em> Reduces network calls, saves battery, works offline.
                <br><em>Challenge:</em> Keeping cache consistent (Invalidation).</p>

              <h5>B. Mobile Middleware (Proxies)</h5>
              <p>Place a proxy server near the mobile.
                <br><em>Role:</em> The proxy filters data, compresses images, and batches requests to reduce traffic.</p>

              <h5>C. Asynchronous Operation</h5>
              <p>Don't block the UI. Let the user continue working while the network request processes in the background (Queued RPC).</p>

              <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Mobile Client-Server systems must be "Adaptive". They must detect network quality and switch between "Online", "Weak", and "Offline" modes dynamically.

            <div class="model-answer-pro">
              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p>Synchronization ensures that the data on a mobile device (Replica) matches the data on the server (Origin). It is essential for offline usage.</p>

              <h4>2. Classification of Protocols</h4>

              <h5>A. Pessimistic (Blocking)</h5>
              <p>Assumes conflicts <em>will</em> happen, so it prevents them.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Locks the data item on the server before the client can edit it.</li>
                <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>Bad for Mobile.</strong> If a mobile user locks a file and goes offline, no one else can work.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>B. Optimistic (Non-Blocking)</h5>
              <p>Assumes conflicts are <em>rare</em>.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Allows clients to edit local copies freely. When they reconnect, the system checks for conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>Good for Mobile.</strong> Supports high availability and offline work.</li>

              <h4>4. SyncML (OMA Data Sync)</h4>
              <p>The industry standard protocol. It uses XML messages to negotiate authentication, device capabilities, and data exchange, ensuring interoperability between different devices and servers.</p>

              <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Optimistic, delta-based synchronization (Fast Sync) is the preferred approach for mobile computing to minimize bandwidth usage and handle disconnections.

          question: "Explain the TORA (Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm).",
          answer: `
            <div class="model-answer-pro">
              <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
              <p><strong>TORA</strong> is a distributed routing protocol for MANETs. Unlike AODV (which finds a single path), TORA is designed to maintain <strong>multiple paths</strong> to the destination.</p>

              <h4>2. Key Concept: The "Height" Metric</h4>
              <p>TORA visualizes the network as a collection of nodes with different "heights" (like a terrain map).</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Destination:</strong> Has the lowest height (The bottom of the valley).</li>
                <li><strong>Source:</strong> Has a higher height.</li>
                <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Data flows "downhill" from high to low.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This creates a <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong> rooted at the destination.</p>

              <h4>3. Operations</h4>

              <h5>A. Route Creation (Query/Update)</h5>
              <p>When a node needs a route, it broadcasts a Query. The destination (or a node that knows it) replies with an Update, setting its height to 0. Neighbors set their height to 1, and so on. This builds the "slope".</p>

              <h5>B. Route Maintenance (Link Failure)</h5>
              <p>This is TORA's strength. If a link breaks (the path downhill is blocked):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The node raises its own "height" to be higher than its neighbors.</li>
                <li>The flow reverses locally. Data flows to a neighbor who has a path.</li>
                <li>This local adjustment limits the spread of control messages.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>4. Pros & Cons</h4>
              <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Supports multiple paths (Robust).</td><td>Complex to implement.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Localized reaction to failure (Scalable).</td><td>Can suffer from oscillations (routing loops).</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good for dense, dynamic networks.</td><td>Requires synchronized clocks (for height metric).</td></tr>
              </table>

              <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> TORA is excellent for highly dynamic networks because it minimizes the control traffic needed to repair broken routes, trading complexity for stability.
