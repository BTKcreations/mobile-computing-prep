              <p>Courts intervene only for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Referring parties to arbitration (Sec 8).</li>
                <li>Interim measures (Sec 9).</li>

                <li>Setting aside an award (Sec 34).</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>4. Conclusion</h4>
              <p>The limited scope of challenge ensures the finality of arbitration, making it an effective alternative to litigation.</p>

                <li><strong>Escrow Account:</strong> Promoters must deposit <strong>70%</strong> of the amounts realized from buyers in a separate scheduled bank account to cover construction and land costs. This prevents fund diversion.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardized Carpet Area:</strong> Promoters must sell properties based on "carpet area" (net usable floor area) rather than "super built-up area".</li>
                <li><strong>Title Representation:</strong> Promoters must provide a clear title to the land.</li>
                <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> Strict penalties (up to 10% of project cost) and imprisonment for non-compliance.</li>
