            <h4>1. Deep Dive: What is Mobile Computing?</h4>
            <div class="definition-box">
              <strong>Mobile Computing</strong> is not just about using a laptop in a cafe. It is a paradigm shift where the <em>computer</em> is no longer the center of attention; the <em>user</em> is. It involves the seamless integration of:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Communication:</strong> The infrastructure (towers, satellites).</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Hardware:</strong> The device (phone, sensor).</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Software:</strong> The OS and Apps (Android, iOS).</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>2. The Paradigm Shift: Fixed vs. Mobile</h4>
            <p>In the traditional <strong>Fixed Computing</strong> model, you go to the computer. The device is tied to a location (desk) and a network (cable).</p>
            <p>In the <strong>Mobile Computing</strong> model, the computer goes with you. This introduces the concept of <strong>"Ubiquitous Computing"</strong> - computing is everywhere.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <br>
              <em>Fixed:</em> You have to go to the bank branch to check your balance. <br>
              <em>Mobile:</em> You check your balance on your phone while riding the bus. The bank has "moved" to your pocket.
            </div>

            <h4>3. Novel Applications (Why do we need it?)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Location Based Services (LBS):</strong> Apps that react to <em>where</em> you are.
                <br><em>Example:</em> <strong>Uber</strong> finding the nearest driver, or <strong>Zomato</strong> suggesting restaurants within 2km.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Mobile Workforce:</strong>
                <br><em>Example:</em> A delivery agent updating the status of a package ("Delivered") instantly from the doorstep using a handheld scanner.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Emergency Services:</strong>
                <br><em>Example:</em> eCall systems in cars that automatically dial 911 and send GPS coordinates when an airbag deploys.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Impediments (The Hard Challenges)</h4>
            <p>Mobile computing isn't perfect. It faces unique challenges that wired networks don't:</p>
            <table class="comparison-table">
              <tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Detailed Explanation</th><th>Example</th></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Bandwidth</strong></td><td>Airwaves are a shared resource. Bandwidth is limited and fluctuates.</td><td>Video buffering when you enter a tunnel.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Security</strong></td><td>Radio waves go through walls. Anyone with an antenna can potentially intercept them.</td><td>Using public Wi-Fi at a cafe is risky without VPN.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Interference</strong></td><td>Weather, buildings, and other devices cause noise.</td><td>Microwave ovens interfering with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Power</strong></td><td>We are tethered by the battery. Performance is throttled to save juice.</td><td>Screen dimming automatically when battery is low.</td></tr>

            <h4>1. Mobile Device Architecture</h4>
            <p>A mobile device is a miniature computer, but with a different architecture focus:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>SoC (System on Chip):</strong> CPU, GPU, Modem, and RAM are often packed into one chip (like Snapdragon or Apple A-series) to save space and power.</li>
              <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> The "eyes and ears" of the device. Accelerometer (tilt), Gyroscope (rotation), GPS (location), Proximity (screen off during calls).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Types of Devices</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Smartphones:</strong> The "Swiss Army Knife". Does everything.</li>
              <li><strong>Wearables:</strong> Smartwatches. Focus on health monitoring and quick notifications. Limited battery.</li>
              <li><strong>Sensors/IoT:</strong> Embedded devices.
                <br><em>Example:</em> A smart agriculture sensor in a field that only wakes up once an hour to report soil moisture.
              </li>

                <p>Battery technology (Li-Ion) hasn't kept pace with Moore's Law. We must design software that "sleeps" as much as possible.</p>

        content: `
          <div class="study-guide-box">
            <h4>1. What is GSM?</h4>
            <p><strong>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)</strong> is the standard that brought us the SIM card and digital voice calls (2G). Before GSM, phones were analog and insecure.</p>

            <h4>2. The Three Subsystems (The "Big Three")</h4>
            <p>Imagine GSM as a postal system:</p>
            
            <h5>A. RSS (Radio Subsystem) - "The Postbox"</h5>
            <p>This is the part you see (the tower) and hold (the phone).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>MS (Mobile Station):</strong> Your phone + SIM. The SIM contains your identity (IMSI).</li>
              <li><strong>BTS (Base Transceiver Station):</strong> The big tower. It handles the radio link with your phone.</li>
              <li><strong>BSC (Base Station Controller):</strong> The "Brain" of the towers. It manages radio resources for multiple BTSs (like handing off a call from one tower to another).</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>B. NSS (Network & Switching Subsystem) - "The Sorting Office"</h5>
            <p>This is the core network that connects calls.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>MSC (Mobile Switching Center):</strong> The main telephone exchange. It routes calls to other users or landlines.</li>
              <li><strong>HLR (Home Location Register):</strong> The "Master Database". It knows who you are, what plan you have, and roughly where you are (which VLR you're in).</li>
              <li><strong>VLR (Visitor Location Register):</strong> The "Temporary Database". When you travel to a new city, the local MSC copies your data from HLR to its VLR to serve you locally.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>C. OSS (Operation Subsystem) - "The Maintenance Crew"</h5>
            <p>Monitors the network for faults, billing, and configuration.</p>

          <div class="study-guide-box">
            <h4>1. Localization (How does the network find you?)</h4>
            <p>Imagine you are traveling. For someone to call you, the network needs to know where you are.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Update:</strong> As you move, your phone listens to the "Broadcast Channel" of nearby towers.</li>
              <li><strong>Location Area (LA):</strong> A group of cells. If you move to a new LA, your phone sends a "Location Update Request".</li>
              <li><strong>VLR Update:</strong> The new VLR records your presence and tells your HLR "He is here now".</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Mobile Terminated Call (MTC) - The "Call Flow"</h4>
            <p>Someone calls your number. What happens?</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Gateway MSC:</strong> The call hits the GMSC. GMSC asks HLR: "Where is this user?"</li>
              <li><strong>HLR Query:</strong> HLR checks its DB. "He is in Mumbai VLR."</li>
              <li><strong>Roaming Number:</strong> HLR asks Mumbai VLR for a temporary number (MSRN).</li>
              <li><strong>Routing:</strong> GMSC routes the call to Mumbai MSC using the MSRN.</li>
              <li><strong>Paging:</strong> Mumbai MSC tells all towers in your area to broadcast: "Incoming call for User X!"</li>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Your phone hears it and rings.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>3. Handover (The "Relay Race")</h4>
            <p>You are driving while talking. You move out of range of Tower A and into Tower B. The call must not drop.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a relay race. The runner (Call) passes the baton (Connection) from one runner (Tower A) to the next (Tower B) without stopping.
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hard Handover (GSM):</strong> "Break before Make". The phone disconnects from A for a split second before connecting to B. You might hear a tiny click.</li>
              <li><strong>Soft Handover (CDMA/3G):</strong> "Make before Break". Connected to both A and B simultaneously for a moment. Smoother.</li>

          <div class="study-guide-box">
            <h4>1. GSM Security (The "Secret Handshake")</h4>
            <p>How does the network know it's really you (and not a clone)?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Authentication (A3 Algorithm):</strong>
                <br>Network sends a random number (Challenge). SIM calculates a result using its secret key (Ki). If the result matches the network's calculation, you are authenticated.
                <br><em>Note:</em> The secret key (Ki) never leaves the SIM card.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Encryption (A5 Algorithm):</strong>
                <br>Once authenticated, the voice data is scrambled so eavesdroppers only hear static.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Anonymity (TMSI):</strong>
                <br>The network rarely uses your real ID (IMSI). It assigns a Temporary ID (TMSI) that changes frequently, so stalkers can't track your signal.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)</h4>
            <p>GSM was built for voice (Circuit Switched). GPRS added <strong>Packet Switching</strong> for data (Internet).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Always On:</strong> Unlike a voice call, you don't "dial up". You are always connected.</li>
              <li><strong>Billing:</strong> You pay by the Megabyte, not the Minute.</li>
              <li><strong>New Nodes:</strong> Added SGSN (like a local router) and GGSN (gateway to the internet).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications)</h4>
            <p>Think of the cordless landline phone in your house. That's DECT.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed for high user density in small areas (offices, homes).</li>
              <li><strong>Picocells:</strong> Very small range (up to 300m).</li>
              <li>Excellent voice quality, no echo.</li>

            <h4>1. The Problem with Wireless</h4>
            <p>In a wired network (Ethernet), everyone can hear everyone. If two people speak at once, they hear the crash (Collision). In wireless, this doesn't work.</p>

            <h4>2. Hidden Terminal Problem (The "Party" Analogy)</h4>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine A and C are at opposite ends of a large party hall. B is in the middle.
              <br>A speaks to B. C cannot hear A (too far).
              <br>C decides to speak to B at the same time.
              <br><strong>Result:</strong> B hears gibberish (Collision). A and C are "hidden" from each other.
            </div>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We need a protocol like RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send). A asks permission first!</p>

            <h4>3. Exposed Terminal Problem</h4>
            <p>B wants to send to C. A is transmitting to someone else. B hears A and thinks "The air is busy, I should wait". But C is far away from A and wouldn't hear A anyway. B is "Exposed" to A and waits unnecessarily, wasting bandwidth.</p>

            <h4>1. SDMA (Space Division) - "Separate Rooms"</h4>
            <p>Use directional antennas. You can talk in the North corner, I can talk in the South corner. We don't interfere.</p>

            <h4>2. FDMA (Frequency Division) - "Different Pitches"</h4>

            <ul><li><em>Pro:</em> Flexible.</li><li><em>Con:</em> We need perfect clocks to synchronize.</li></ul>

            <h4>4. CDMA (Code Division) - "Different Languages"</h4>
            <p>We all speak at the same time on the same frequency! But I speak English, and you speak French. The receiver filters out everything except English.</p>

            <h4>1. Why TCP hates Wireless</h4>
            <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the backbone of the internet. It guarantees delivery. It was designed for <strong>Wired Networks</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>The Misunderstanding:</strong>
              <br>In wired networks, if a packet is lost, it's almost always because of <strong>Congestion</strong> (traffic jam). TCP's reaction is to <strong>Slow Down</strong>.
              <br>In wireless, packets are lost because of <strong>Noise</strong> or <strong>Handover</strong> (brief disconnect). The network isn't full!
              <br><strong>Result:</strong> TCP slows down unnecessarily, killing your download speed.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Solutions (Fixing TCP)</h4>
            
            <h5>A. Indirect TCP (I-TCP) - "The Split"</h5>
            <p>Split the connection at the Base Station (Tower).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Standard TCP:</strong> Server <-> Tower. (Fast, wired).</li>
              <li><strong>Wireless TCP:</strong> Tower <-> Phone. (Optimized for wireless).</li>
              <li><em>Problem:</em> If the Tower crashes, the Server thinks the Phone got the data (because the Tower acknowledged it). Breaks end-to-end reliability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>B. Snooping TCP - "The Helper"</h5>
            <p>The Tower spies on the packets. If it sees a packet is missing (gap in sequence), it quickly re-sends it from its own cache <em>before</em> the Server notices.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Benefit:</em> Server doesn't slow down. End-to-end reliability is kept.</li>
              <li><em>Problem:</em> Doesn't work with Encryption (HTTPS), because the Tower can't read the packet headers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>C. Mobile TCP (M-TCP) - "The Pauser"</h5>
            <p>When you disconnect (e.g., entering an elevator), the Tower tells the Server: "<strong>Pause!</strong> Don't send anything, and don't slow down. Just wait." (Sets window size to 0). When you reconnect, it says "Resume".</p>

          <div class="study-guide-box">
            <h4>1. The Disconnection Problem</h4>
            <p>Mobile devices are frequently offline (tunnel, flight, poor signal). How do we access data?</p>

            <h4>2. Hoarding (Prefetching)</h4>
            <p>Downloading data <em>before</em> you need it.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Example: Google Maps Offline Areas</strong>
              <br>Before a trip, you download the map of the city. Even if you lose signal, you can still navigate. This is hoarding.
            </div>

            <h4>3. Caching</h4>
            <p>Storing data you <em>recently</em> used.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Faster access (RAM is faster than 4G) and saves battery (radio stays off).</li>
              <li><strong>Challenge: Consistency.</strong> If the stock price changes on the server, your cached version is wrong (Stale). We need "Invalidation Reports" - the server telling the phone "Hey, that data is old, delete it!"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Kangaroo Transactions</h4>
            <p>A transaction (like a bank transfer) might take time. If you move to a new Tower while it's processing, the transaction "hops" with you, like a Kangaroo carrying its joey. It doesn't restart from scratch.</p>

            <h4>1. The Asymmetry</h4>
            <p>Mobile devices are "Consumers". They download huge videos but only upload small clicks. The bandwidth is <strong>Asymmetric</strong> (Downlink >> Uplink).</p>

            <h4>2. Push Mechanism (Broadcast)</h4>
            <p>The server sends data to everyone without them asking.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Analogy: Radio Station</strong>
              <br>The DJ plays a song. Everyone tuned in hears it. It costs the DJ the same effort whether 1 person listens or 1 million.
              <br><em>Use Case:</em> Stock tickers, News headlines, Traffic alerts.
            </div>
            <ul><li><em>Pro:</em> Extremely scalable.</li><li><em>Con:</em> You get data you might not want (Spam).</li></ul>

            <h4>3. Pull Mechanism (On-Demand)</h4>
            <p>The user asks for specific data.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Analogy: Web Browsing</strong>
              <br>You type a URL. The server sends that specific page.
            </div>
            <ul><li><em>Pro:</em> You get exactly what you want.</li><li><em>Con:</em> If 1 million people ask at once, the server crashes.</li></ul>

            <h4>4. Hybrid</h4>

            <h4>1. Saving Battery</h4>
            <p>Listening to a broadcast stream drains battery. The CPU has to check every packet: "Is this for me? No. Is this for me? No."</p>

            <h4>2. Indexing</h4>
            <p>The server sends a "Table of Contents" (Index) at the start of the cycle.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Scenario:</strong>
              <br>Server: "Sports is at Minute 5. Weather is at Minute 10."
              <br>Phone: Reads Index. "I want Weather." -> <strong>Sleeps</strong> for 9 minutes. -> <strong>Wakes up</strong> at Minute 10 to download Weather.
            </div>

            <h4>1. The Sync Problem</h4>
            <p>You edit a document on your phone while offline. Your colleague edits the same document on the server. When you reconnect, whose version wins?</p>

            <h4>2. Conflict Resolution Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Server Wins:</strong> Your phone's changes are discarded. (Safe but frustrating).</li>
              <li><strong>Client Wins:</strong> You overwrite your colleague's work. (Dangerous).</li>
              <li><strong>Timestamp:</strong> The last person to save wins.</li>
              <li><strong>Merge:</strong> The software tries to combine both (like Git merge). If it can't, it asks the user.</li>

            <p>Every device (Node) talks directly to its neighbors. If it wants to talk to someone far away, the neighbors pass the message along (Multi-hop).</p>

            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Scenario:</strong> An earthquake destroys all cell towers. Rescuers arrive.
              <br>Rescuer A (at Base) needs to talk to Rescuer C (in the rubble). They are too far apart.
              <br>Rescuer B is halfway between them.
              <br>A sends to B -> B forwards to C.
              <br>They have formed a MANET instantly.

            <h4>How do we find the path?</h4>

            <h4>1. Proactive (Table-Driven) - DSDV</h4>
            <p><strong>"The Map Approach"</strong></p>
            <p>Every node keeps a full map of the network (Routing Table). "To reach C, go through B."</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Pro:</em> Instant. You already know the way.</li>
              <li><em>Con:</em> If nodes move, you spend all your time updating the map, even if no one is talking. Wastes battery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Reactive (On-Demand) - DSR / AODV</h4>
            <p><strong>"The Asking Directions Approach"</strong></p>
            <p>I don't know the way to C. I'll shout (Broadcast): "Does anyone know C?"</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>RREQ (Route Request):</strong> The shout spreads through the network.</li>
              <li><strong>RREP (Route Reply):</strong> C hears it and replies: "I'm here! The path is A->B->C."</li>
              <li><em>Pro:</em> Saves battery. No updates unless you need to talk.</li>
              <li><em>Con:</em> Initial delay. You have to wait for the reply before sending data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. AODV vs DSR</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>DSR (Source Routing):</strong> The entire path "A-B-C-D" is written in the packet header. Good for small networks.</li>
              <li><strong>AODV (Hop-by-Hop):</strong> Like road signs. Packet just says "Destination D". Node A looks at sign: "For D, go to B". Node B looks: "For D, go to C". Less overhead.</li>
